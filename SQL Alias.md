SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.  
Aliases are often used to make column names more readable.  
An alias only exists for the duration of that query.  
An alias is created with the AS keyword.  
### 1. When displaying the Customers table, make an ALIAS of the PostalCode column, the column should be called Pno instead.
